MÃ¡rcia,

The notebooks to be evaluated for databricks so far are:

Â» "databricks_step_by_step_part1.ipynb"  ==> fake news dataset load and model creation (fake [0], real [1])

Â» "databricks_step_by_step_part2.ipynb"  ==> streaming simmulation with datasets of tweets to be predicted by the model.

Datasets (fake.csv and real.csv) downloaded from:
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

Actual notebooks (databricks_step_by_step_part1 and part2) are totally functional inside databricks.
